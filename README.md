The targeted trend for the examination of the CitiBike Data was derived from the Women Bike Month Blog post from October 2018 as a gauge for active participant outreach.  The resulting data set was files collected from the CitiBike data file repository including September 2018, October 2018, November 2018, Septemper 2019, October 2019, and November 2019.  The files were selected from the lesser examined **_Jersey City_** stations and multiple years were selected to be able to identify seasonality and to span a reasonable time frame.  A final CSV file was produced using the Jupyter Notebook file included in the repository.

## Observations:

* The blog post and promotion did not noticably increase female ridership during the month of October 2018 and the promotion did not appear to be repeated in 2019.
* The decline in overall ridership starting in the Fall and heading into Winter Months appears to be more of a driving factor in the decline of both declared gender types.
* The observed drop in "Customer" rides can probably be related to the decrease in tourism as the weather turns colder.
* Comparing 2018 to 2019, ridership has clearly increased during that time interval however it seems to be a proportional increase across both declared gender types (male and female).
* When comparing account types across the gender spectrum as seen in the block diagram subscriber ridership is still a greater proportion than individual use customers.
* When examining age, ridership in Jersey City seems to be most popular amongst individual in their early 30's. And this appears to correspond with the Median Age census data overlayed on the station maps. (Age calculations removed riders with a birthdate 1969 -common fictitious birthdate- and anyone with listed age above 100 years old was removed for the same practical reason).
